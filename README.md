**Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard: Project Summary**

### Project Overview
This project involved creating an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which details the microbial species found in human navels. The analysis focused on operational taxonomic units (OTUs) that highlight microbial diversity across different individuals.


### Interactive Dashboard Development
- Developed an interactive web dashboard that allows users to explore various microbial species found in human navels.
- Implemented features that display the prevalence of certain microbes across populations, emphasizing those found in over 70% of sampled individuals versus rarer types.

### Insights and Impact
The dashboard provides an engaging and educational tool for users to understand the biodiversity of microbes in human navels, illustrating the commonality and rarity of certain microbes across different people. This project not only enhances public understanding of microbial biodiversity but also supports further scientific research and curiosity in microbiology.
